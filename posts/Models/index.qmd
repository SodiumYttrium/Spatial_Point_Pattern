The last topic on this project will be about different models for point patterns,
including:

- Contagious distributions
- Poisson cluster processes
- Inhomogeneous Poisson processes
- Cox processes

# Contagious distributions
The term was first used by Neyman [@Neyman] to describe discrete distributions that
exhibits contagious or clustering behaviour. Neyman proposed a Poisson process of egg-
masses. Larvae hatch from these eggs, and then move to positions relative to
the eggs according to a bivariate distribution.

Suppose the number of egg clusters is $M$, which follows a Poisson process of
intensity $\rho$, and each cluster produces a random number $S$ of offspring (larvae).
Therefore $M$ follows a Poisson distribution with mean $\rho |A|$. The number of
larvae in region $A$ is $N(A) = S_1 + \dots + S_M$. If the probability generating
function (pgf) of $S$ is $\pi_s(z)$, the pgf for $N(A)$ is:
$$
\pi(z; A) = exp[-\rho |A| \{1-\pi_s(z)\}]
$$
Neyman's Type A distribution is obtained by setting $\pi_s(z) = exp[-\mu(1-z)]$.

Now let the number of egg masses per unit area follow a Poisson process of mean $k\rho$,
where $k$ also follows a Poisson distribution with a known mean. In this case, we get a
*mixed*, or *compound* Poisson distribution. The number of larvae per unit area 
still follows a Neyman's Type A distribution.

However according to Evans [@Evans], plant quadrat count data are very well fitted to
Neyman's Type A distribution, but not insect counts. Instead, insect count data are
fitted by the negative binomial distribution. This is possibility due to greater
competition and overcrowding in plants.

The negative binomial distribution is obtained when $S$ has a logarithmic series
distribution with $\pi_s(z) = 1 - log\{1+\beta(1-z)\}/log(1+\beta)$ for some $\beta > 0$.
It can be derived as a *compounded*, or *mixed* Poisson distribution, in which the parameter
is determined by random sampling from a gamma distribution.

# Poisson cluster processes
Poisson cluster processes follow 3 postulates:

- Parent events follow a Poisson process with intensity $\rho$.
- $S_i$, the number of offspring that the $i$th parent produces, are independent and identically
distributed, with probability distribution $p_s: s = 0, 1, \dots$
- The positions of the offspring relative to the parents are also independent and identically
distributed with a bivariate pdf $h$.

Let the  pdf of the vector difference between positions of 2 offspring with the same parent be:
$$
h_2(x) = \int h(x)h(x-y)dx
$$
And denote the corresponding cdf as $H_2(x)$. For an arbitrary event in a cluster of
size $S$, the expected number of other events from the same cluster located within
distance $t$ is $(S-1)H_2(t)$. The probability distribution of the cluster size of the
arbitrary event is obtained by length-biased sampling from the cluster size distribution,
$p(s)$: We get $p*(s) = sp(s)/\mu$, where $\mu = E(S)$. Taking the average, we get that
the expected number of related events within distance $t$ is $E[S(S-1)]H_2(t)/\mu$.

For unrelated events, since they are assumed to be located independently of the parent
event, the expected number of unrelated events within distance $t$ of the arbitrary event
is $\lambda \pi t^2$. Summing up the formulae for both related and unrelated events,
we get:
$$
\lambda K(t) = \lambda \pi t^2 + E[S(S-1)]H_2(t)/\mu
$$
Dividing by $\lambda = \rho \mu$, we obtain the K-function:
$$
K(t) = \pi t^2 + E[S(S-1)]H_2(t)/(\rho \mu ^2)
$$
As $t \rightarrow \infty$, $K(t) - \pi t^2$ tends to a constant, $E[S(S-1)]/(\rho \mu^2)$.

# Inhomogeneous Poisson processes
The 2 main properties for an inhomogeneous Poisson process are:

- $N(A)$ has a Poisson distribution with mean $\int_A \lambda(x) dx$.
- Given there are $n$ events in region $A$, they are an independent random sample of
a distribution on $A$ with a pdf proportional to the rate, $\lambda(x)$.

By having the intensity as a function of spatial location, covariates may be introduced.
Diggle has given an example: suppose the locations of a species of tree depends on the
elavation of the ground. Then a possible intensity function may be $\lambda(x) =$
$exp(\alpha + \beta z(x))$, where $z(x)$ denotes the elavation at location $x$.

In ecology, species presence-only data may be modelled with inhomogeneous Poisson processes.
To account for sampling bias and detection errors, the data should be treated as a thinned data. [@IPP1]
We assume that the expected occurrences of in the region $A$ is a Poisson random variable
with mean $\mu(A) = \int_A \lambda(s) ds$. [@Dorazio] $\lambda(s)$ is formulated as
a log-linear function with unknown parameters $\beta$ and location-specific covariates $x(s)$
(such as elevation and temperature). We obtain a formula of the form:
$$
log(\lambda(s)) = \beta'x(s) = \beta_0 + \displaystyle \sum_{j=1}^l \beta_j x_j(s)
$$
Assuming an individual is present at location $s$. The probability of it being detected is $b(s)$, where:
$$
logit(b(s)) = \alpha' w(s) = \alpha_0 + \displaystyle \sum_{j=1}^g \alpha_j w_j(s)
$$
where $w(s)$ are location-specific covariates (such as distance to a road and populaà¦§on
centres).

The likelihood function for estimating $\alpha$ and $\beta$ is:
$$
L(\beta, \alpha) = exp(-\int_A \lambda(s) b(s) ds) \displaystyle \prod_{i=1}^m \lambda(s_i)b(s_i)
$$

# Cox processes
The logic behind using the Poisson cluster process is that related events may cluster.
Another reason for aggregation might be environmental heterogeneity, which we account for
using the inhomogeneous Poisson process. However, this environmental heterogeneity itself
might be stochastic. A Poisson process with stochastic intensity functions is called a *Cox process*.

A spatial Cox process can be defined by the following postulates:

- $\{\Lambda(x): x \in \mathbb{R}^2 \}$ is a non-negative-valued stochastic process.
- Conditional on $\{\Lambda(x) = \lambda(x): x \in \mathbb{R}^2 \}$, the event form an
inhomogeneous Poisson process with intensity function $\lambda(x)$.

A Cox process is stationary if and only if the intensity process $\Lambda(x)$ is stationary.
In this case, the intensity for the Cox process is obtained from taking expectation of the
intensity process: $\lambda = E[\Lambda(x)]$.

Given $\{\Lambda(x)\}$, the conditional intensity of a pair of events at locations $x$ and $y$
respectively, is $\Lambda(x)\Lambda(y)$. Therefore $\lambda_2(x,y) = E[\Lambda(x)\Lambda(y)]$.
In the stationary, isotropic case, this can be written as $\lambda_2(t) = \lambda^2 + \gamma(t)$,
where $t = ||x-y||$ and $\gamma(t) = Cov\{\Lambda(x), \Lambda(y)\}$.

According to Kingman [@Kingman], we can use Cox processes to model for a reproducing population as well.
Denote $G_n$ as the point process that generates the locations, $X_i$, of individuals in the $n$th
generation. Suppose reproduction obeys the following rules:

- For a parent at location $x_i$, the number of offspring produced is a Poisson random variable
with mean $\mu_i = \mu_i(G_n)$
- The offspring's locations relative to the parent follows a bivariate pdf and are independent from each other.

These rules are similar to the Poisson cluster process, but allow $\mu_i$ to depend on
the configuration of the parents. $G_{n+1}$ is thus the process defining the locations of the
offspring. It is a Cox process defined by:
$$
\Lambda(x) = \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^\infty \mu_i (G_n) h(x-x_i)
$$
where $x_i$ are events of the $n$th generation.
