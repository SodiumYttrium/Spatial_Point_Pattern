Now we will investigate some CSR tests, with the help of the `spatstat` package in RStudio.

# Inter-event distances

Our first method would be based on the distances between each pair of distinct events.
We denote the distance between events $i$ and $j$ as $t_{ij}$. For $n$ events, there
are $\frac{1}{2}n(n-1)$ distinct pairs of events in total.

Now we define the distribution function of the distances, $t$, for CSR. For a unit square:
$$
H(t) =
\begin{cases}
\pi t^2 - \frac{8}{3}t^3 + \frac{1}{2}t^4 & \text{if } & 0\leq t\leq 1 \\
\frac{1}{3} - 2t^2 - \frac{1}{2}t^4 + \frac{4}{3}(t^2 - 1)^\frac{1}{2}(2t^2 + 1)
+ 2t^2\sin^{-1}(2t^{-2}-1) & \text{if } & 1 < t\leq \sqrt{2} \\
\end{cases}
$$
And for a circle of unit radius:
$$
H(t) = 1+\pi^{-1}\{2(t^2-1)\cos^{-1}(\frac{t}{2}) - t(1+\frac{t^2}{2})\sqrt{1-\frac{t^2}{4}}\}
$$
for all $0 \leq t \leq 2$. Indeed, $H(t)$ varies depending on the size and shape of
the sampling region $A$.

Assume that $H(t)$ for the region in interest is known. We then calculate the
empirical distribution function (EDF):
$$
\hat{H}_1(t) = \{\frac{1}{2}n(n-1)\}^{-1} \#(t_{ij} \leq t)
$$
where $\#(t_{ij} \leq t)$ means the number of observed distances that are at most $t$.

Next, we simulate $n$ events under CSR $s-1$ times. From these we obtain $\hat{H}_i(t)$
for $i=2, 3, \dots, s$. Hereby we obtain the upper and lower envelopes:
$$
U(t)= \text{max}\{\hat{H}_i(t)\}; \space L(t)= \text{min}\{\hat{H}_i(t)\}
$$
$\hat{H}_1(t), U(t)$ and $L(t)$ can be plotted against $H(t)$. If $\hat{H}_1(t)$ lies close
to $H(t)$ and is between $U(t)$ and $L(t)$ throughout the range, we may accept CSR.

My replication of Diggle's plot on Japanese black pine saplings, using 99 simulations
of CSR for the envelopes, affirms acceptance of CSR. This agrees with [@Bartlett] and
[@Besag], who used a $\chi^2$ test on a histogram of inter-event distances.

```{r}
library(spatstat)
library(attention)

jpp <- japanesepines

n <- 65
pd <- pairdist(jpp, periodic=FALSE, method="C", squared=FALSE, metric=NULL)

Hhat = function(t){sum(pd[lower.tri(pd)] <= t) / (n*(n-1)/2)}
H = function(t){
  if (0 <= t && t <= 1) {
    pi*t^2 - 8/3*t^3 + t^4/2
  } else if (1 < t && t <= 1.42) {
    1/3 - 2*t^2 - t^4/2 + 4*(t^2 - 1)^(1/2)*(2*t^2 + 1)/3 +2*t^2*asin(2*t^(-2) - 1)
  }
}

dist <- seq(from = 0, to = 1.42, by = 0.01)

H_apply <- lapply(dist, H)
Hhat_apply <- lapply(dist, Hhat)

pdlist <- vector("list", length = length(dist))
pdmat <- matrix(nrow = 99, ncol = length(dist))
for (i in 1:99) {
  pts <- runifpoint(n, win=window(jpp))
  pds <- pairdist(pts, periodic=FALSE, method="C", squared=FALSE, metric=NULL)
  pdsvec <- pds[lower.tri(pds)]
  for (t in dist) {
    pdmat[i, which(dist == t)] <- sum(pdsvec <= t)
  }
}
ulist <- RowMax(t(pdmat))
llist <-apply(pdmat, 2, min, simplify = TRUE)
U <- lapply(ulist, function(t) t/((n*(n-1))/2))
L <- lapply(llist, function(t) t/((n*(n-1))/2))


plot(H_apply, Hhat_apply, col='green', type='l')

lines(H_apply, L, col='cyan')
legend(x=0,y=1,c("data","upper envelope", "lower envelope"),cex=.8,col=c("green","red", "cyan"),pch=c(1,2,3))
```

## Monte Carlo test

2 ways to construct an exact Monte Carlo test for CSR are as below:

i) Choose $t_0$ and let $u_i = \hat{H}_i(t_0)$. The rank of $u_1$ is a basis for the
test as under CSR, all rankings of $u_1$ are equally probable.

ii) Define $u_i$ to be a measure of variation between $\hat{H}_i(t)$ and $H(t)$, e.g.
$u_i = \int \{\hat{H}_i(t)-H(t)\}^2 \space dt$, then base the test on the rank of $u_1$.

For (i), we would need to choose a sensible $t_0$ for the problem. While (ii) is more
objective, it may not be a powerful test for inter-event distances.

For a region A in which $H(t)$ is unknown, we can replace it by:
$$
\bar{H}_i(t) = \frac{\displaystyle \sum_{j \ne i}\hat{H}_j(t)}{s-1}
$$
While $u_i$ under CSR is no longer independent, it still fulfills the requirement that
all rankings of $u_1$ are equi-probable, as they are inter-changeable. We can plot
$U(t), \space L(t)$ and $\hat{H}_1(t)$ against $\bar{H}_1(t)$. Since $\bar{H}_1(t)$
only depends on simulations of CSR, it is an unbiased estimate of H(t).

# Nearest neighbour distances

Our second method is measuring the distances to the closest neighbour from each event. For
situations in which events interact with each other on a small physical scale, such as
trees competing for sunlight and nutrients within a small relative area, we can focus on
'small' inter-event distances when a precise threshold distance is hard to specify.

Let $y_i$ be the closest neighbour distance of the $i$th event. Define the EDF:
$$
\hat{G}_1(y) = \frac{1}{n}\#(y_i \leq y)
$$
The theoretical distribution of $y$ under CSR depends on $n$ and the region $A$.
With $|A|$ being the area of the region, the probability of an arbitrary event is
within distance $y$ of another specified event is $\frac{\pi y^2}{|A|}$, i.e. the
area of a circle with radius $y$ over the area of $A$. Since the events are located
independently, the approximate distribution of $y$ is:
$$
G(y) = 1 - (1 - \frac{\pi y^2}{|A|})^{n-1}
$$
For a large $n$, let $\lambda = \frac{n}{|A|}$. The approximation is:
$$
G(y) = 1 - exp(-\lambda \pi y^2): \space y \geq 0
$$

## Monte Carlo test

Possible test statistics for the Monte Carlo test could be $\bar{y}$, the sample mean
of the nearest distances, or
$$
u_i = \int \{\hat{G}_i(y)-\bar{G}_i(y)\}^2 \space dy,
$$
where
$$
\bar{G}_i(y) = \frac{1}{s-1}  \displaystyle\sum_{j \ne i} \hat{G}_j(y)
$$
An advantage of using $\bar{y}$ is that simulation is unnecessary. As shown by
Donnelly(1978), $\bar{y}$ under CSR is Normally distributed, with mean and variance:
$$
E(\bar{y}) = 0.5(\frac{n}{|A|})^{1/2} + \frac{1}{n}(0.051+0.042n^{-1/2})P
$$
and
$$
Var(\bar{y}) = 0.070n^{-2}|A|+0.037(n^{-5}|A|)^{1/2}P
$$
where P is the perimeter of region A. Significantly small or large \bar{y}
suggests aggregation or regularity, respectively.

# Point to nearest event distances

The third method uses the distances between the $m$ arbitrary sample points to the
nearest of the $n$ events. Let $x_i$ be such distances, and our EDF would be:
$$
\hat{F}(x) = \frac{1}{m} \#(x_i \leq x)
$$
This EDF would measure the empty spaces in region A, where $1-\hat{F}(x)$ would be
approximately equal to the area of space in region A that is at least distance $x$
away from any event.

Similar to how the approximation of $G(y)$ for large $n$ was derived, under CSR,
the approximation of $F(x)$ is as follows:
$$
F(x) = 1-exp(-\lambda \pi x^2): \space x \geq 0
$$
where $\lambda = \frac{n}{|A|}$, once again.

# Quadrat counts

We have looked into 3 different methods for CSR testing based on distances. Instead of
measuring distances, we may divide the observed region $A$ into equally sized *quadrats*,
and take counts of events in each quadrat.

Under CSR, the expected number of events in each quadrat should be equal. We can perform
the $\chi^2$ goodness-of-fit test, obtaining the test statistic from  Pearson's
criterion,
$$
X^2 = \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^m \frac{(n_i - \bar{n})^2}{\bar{n}}
$$
Its null distribution is $\chi_{m-1}^2$, provided that $\bar{n}$ is not too small and
that each $x_i$ is at least 5. If $P(\chi_{m-1}^2 > X^2)$ is less than the significance level,
we may reject CSR.

For the data set of Japanese black pine saplings, we may use a $3 \times 3$ grid to
ensure that the expected frequencies are at least 5. Below is the observation:
```{r}
quadrats <- quadratcount(jpp, nx = 3, ny = 3)
quadrats
```
To perform the $\chi^2$ test, we may employ the `quadrat.test` function:
```{r}
quadrat.test(jpp, nx=3, ny=3)
```
Here we observe that the p-value is 0.1119, so evidence against CSR is weak.
