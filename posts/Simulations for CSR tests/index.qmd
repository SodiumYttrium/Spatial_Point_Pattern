This post will be a collection of simulations I made based on the materials from
the post 'Testing for CSR'. The data I will be using are:

- Locations of 65 Japanese black pine saplings in a square of side-length 5.7
metres [@Numata]

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(japanesepines)
```

- Locations of 62 redwood seedlings in a square of side-length 23 metres
[@Strauss; @MSP]

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(redwood3)
```

- Locations of 42 cell centres in a unit square [@MSP]

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cells)
```

- Locations of 3604 trees of the species Beilschmiedia pendula (Lauraceae) in a 1000 by 500 metre rectangular sampling region in the tropical rainforest of Barro Colorado Island [@HF;@CHF;@Condit]

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(bei)
```

The first 3 have been used for demonstration in Diggle's book, and my plots indeed show
similar results to Diggle's.

# Inter-event distances

```{r, echo=FALSE}
Hfunc <- function(data, dist){

    pts <- runifpoint(n, win=window(data))
    pds <- pairdist(pts, periodic=FALSE, method="C", squared=FALSE, metric=NULL)
    pdsvec <- pds[lower.tri(pds)]
    for (t in dist) {
      pdmat[i, which(dist == t)] <- sum(pdsvec <= t)
    }
  }

  U <- lapply(ulist, function(t) t/((n*(n-1))/2))
  L <- lapply(llist, function(t) t/((n*(n-1))/2))

## Japanese black pines
My replication of Diggle's plot on Japanese black pine saplings, using 99 simulations
of CSR for the envelopes, affirms acceptance of CSR. This agrees with [@Bartlett] and
[@Besag], who used a $\chi^2$ test on a histogram of inter-event distances.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
Hfunc(japanesepines, seq(from = 0, to = 1.42, by = 0.01))
```

## Redwood
$\hat{H}_1(t)$ is greater than $H(t)$ throughout the range, especially for very small and very
large values of $H(t)$, where $\hat{H}_1(t)$ exceeds the upper envelope. The excess
number of small values of $H(t)$ may be explained by Strauss' remark that a distance of
6 feet on the ground ($t \approx 0.08$), was "very roughly the range at which
a pair of seedlings could interact."

A formal test of significance based on the measure of the discrepancy between
$\hat{H}_1(t)$ and $H(t)$, however, might suggest acceptance of CSR with a significance
level of 0.22, according to Diggle. Indeed, $\hat{H}_1(t)$ lies relatively close to $H(t)$
throughout the range. This shows that observation of the EDF plot with the simulation
envelopes may provide insights that formal tests of significance do not.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
Hfunc(redwood3, seq(from = 0, to = 1.42, by = 0.01))
```

## Cells
Again, a formal test of significance may suggest acceptance of CSR, with a significance
level of 0.23. However with parts of the graph (especially at low values of $H(t)$)
lying outside the simulation envelopes, it suggests otherwise. Note that for small values of $t$,
$\hat{H}_1(t)=0$, i.e. small inter-event distances are absent. This explains the regularity
of the pattern. Also, for large values of $t$, $\hat{H}_1(t)$ lies close to the upper
envelope. Looking at the graph depicting the data, we can observe that there are no
events present at the corners of the square. These empty spaces result in lack of
large inter-event distances.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
Hfunc(cells, seq(from = 0, to = 1.42, by = 0.01))
```

## Beilschmiedia pendula (Lauraceae)
Clearly, with the excess of small inter-event distances and the deficit of larger
inter-event distances, we have sufficient evidence to reject CSR. This is to be expected,
as we see from the graph that events are clustered around certain areas, with large
empty spaces near the middle part of the region and to the right.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
Hfunc(bei, seq(from = 0, to = 1100, by = 10))
```

# Nearest neighbour distance

```{r, echo=FALSE}
Gfunc <- function(data, dist){
  n <- data$n
  Y <- vector("list", length = n)
  pd <- pairdist(data, periodic=FALSE, method="C", squared=FALSE, metric=NULL)
  for (i in 1:n) {
    Y[[i]] <- min(pd[i, -i])
  }
  A <- area(window(data))
  G  = function(y){1 - (1 - pi*y^2/A)^(n-1)}
  Ghat = function(y){sum(Y <= y)/n}
  G_apply <- lapply(dist, G)
  Ghat_apply <- lapply(dist, Ghat)
  
  gpdmat <- matrix(nrow = 99, ncol = length(dist))
  
  for (i in 1:99) {
    gpdsvec <- vector("list", length = n)
    gpts <- runifpoint(n, win=window(data))
    gpds <- pairdist(gpts, periodic=FALSE, method="C", squared=FALSE, metric=NULL)
    diag(gpds) <- diag(gpds) + 1000
    gpdsvec[[i]] <- apply(gpds, 2, min, simplify = TRUE)
    for (y in dist) {
      gpdmat[i, which(dist == y)] <- sum(unlist(gpdsvec) <= y)
    }
  }
  gulist <- apply(gpdmat, 2, max, simplify = TRUE)
  gllist <-apply(gpdmat, 2, min, simplify = TRUE)
  gU <- lapply(gulist, function(t) t/n)
  gL <- lapply(gllist, function(t) t/n)
  
  plot(G_apply, Ghat_apply, col='green', type='l', xlim=c(0,1))
  lines(G_apply, gU, col='red')
  lines(G_apply, gL, col='cyan')
  legend(x=0,y=1,c("data","upper envelope", "lower envelope"),cex=.8,col=c("green","red", "cyan"),pch=c(1,2,3))
}
```

## Japanese black pines
This plot suggests acceptance of CSR. According to Diggle, a formal Monte Carlo test
based on the squared difference between $\hat{G}$ and $\bar{G}$ arrives at the same
conclusion with significance level 0.52.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
Gfunc(japanesepines, seq(from = 0, to = 0.54, by = 0.01))
```

## Redwood
With a large proportion of $\hat{G}$ lying above the upper envelope, there is strong
evidence for rejecting CSR. This is supported by the Monte Carlo test, in which $u_1$
is larger than all 99 simulated $u_j$.

The excess of nearest neighbour distances is typical for an aggregated pattern like
these redwood seedlings.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
Gfunc(redwood3, seq(from = 0, to = 0.54, by = 0.01))
```

## Cells
Again, there is strong evidence against CSR. The Monte Carlo test also gives a $u_1$
that is comfortably larger than all the other $u_j$. Note that there is a lack of small
nearest neighbour distances, characteristic of regular patterns.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
Gfunc(cells, seq(from = 0, to = 0.54, by = 0.01))
```

## Beilschmiedia pendula (Lauraceae)
Similar to the behaviour of the redwood saplings, there is a large proportion of
$\hat{G}$ above the upper envelope, so we may reject CSR.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
Gfunc(bei, seq(from = 0, to = 72, by = 1))
```

# Point to nearest event distances

```{r, echo=FALSE}
Ffunc <- function(data, x, y, dist){
  n <- data$n
  A <- area(window(data))
  F <- function(z){1-exp(-pi*n*z^2/A)}
  
  x_coords <- seq(from = window(data)$window$xrange[1], to = window(data)$window$xrange[2], by = 1/(x-1))
  y_coords <- seq(from = window(data)$window$yrange[1], to = window(data)$window$yrange[2], by = 1/(y-1))
  d_grid <- expand.grid(x = x_coords, y = y_coords)
  d_grid <- as.ppp(d_grid, W = window(data))
  
  dpdist <- nncross(d_grid, data, what='dist')
  
  Fhat <- function(z){sum(dpdist <= z)/d_grid$n}
  
  F_apply <- lapply(dist, F)
  Fhat_apply <- lapply(dist, Fhat)
  
  fpdmat <- matrix(nrow = 99, ncol = length(dist))
  for (i in 1:99) {
    fpts <- runifpoint(n, win=window(data))
    fpds <- nncross(d_grid, fpts, what='dist')
    for (t in dist) {
      fpdmat[i, which(dist == t)] <- sum(fpds <= t)
    }
  }
  
  fulist <- apply(fpdmat, 2, max, simplify = TRUE)
  fllist <-apply(fpdmat, 2, min, simplify = TRUE)
  fU <- lapply(fulist, function(t) t/d_grid$n)
  fL <- lapply(fllist, function(t) t/d_grid$n)
  
  plot(F_apply, Fhat_apply, col='green', type='l', xlim=c(0,1), ylim=c(0,1))
  lines(F_apply, fU, col='red')
  lines(F_apply, fL, col='cyan')
  legend(x=0,y=1,c("data","upper envelope", "lower envelope"),cex=.8,col=c("green","red", "cyan"),pch=c(1,2,3))
}
```

## Japanese black pines
This plot is obtained using a regular grid of 256 ($16 \times 16$) points over the window. We see
that $\hat{F}$ lies close to $F$ throughout the range and between the envelopes.
Just like our previous analysis of this data, we accept CSR.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
Ffunc(japanesepines, 16, 16, seq(from = 0, to = 0.2, by = 0.005))
```

## Redwood
Again, we obtain the plot using the regular pattern of 256 points. Clearly $\hat{F}$
lies below the lower envelope for most of the range, suggesting rejection of CSR. This
is a typical behaviour of aggregated pattern.

Performing a Monte Carlo test based on the squared differences between $\hat{F}$
and $\bar{F}$ gives the same conclusion, with $u_1$ larger than all 99 simulated $u_j$.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
Ffunc(redwood3, 16, 16, seq(from = 0, to = 1.15, by = 0.01))
```

## Cells
This time we use a regular grid of 196 ($14 \times 14$) points. With a large proportion of
the graph of $\hat{F}$ lying above the upper envelope, CSR is rejected. The Monte
Carlo test agrees with this at the significant level of 0.02, according to Diggle.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
Ffunc(cells, 14, 14, seq(from = 0, to = 0.25, by = 0.005))
```

## Beilschmiedia pendula (Lauraceae)
The regular grid I used is of 7200 ($120 \times 60$) points. Again, similar to
the redwood saplings, $\hat{F}$ lies below the lower envelope for the most part.
This suggests that CSR may be rejected, and this is an aggregated pattern.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
Ffunc(bei, 120, 60, seq(from = 0, to = 119, by = 1))
```

# Quadrat counts

## Japanese black pines
For the data set of Japanese black pine saplings, we may use a $3 \times 3$ grid to
ensure that the expected frequencies are at least 5. Below is the observation:
```{r}
quadratcount(japanesepines, nx = 3, ny = 3)
```
To perform the $\chi^2$ test, we may employ the `quadrat.test` function:
```{r}
quadrat.test(japanesepines, nx=3, ny=3, alternative='clustered')
```
Here we observe that the one-sided p-value is about 0.06, so evidence against CSR is weak.

## Redwood
Again we use a $3 \times 3$ grid for this dataset to keep the expected counts over 5.
```{r}
quadratcount(redwood3, nx = 3, ny = 3)
```

```{r}
quadrat.test(redwood3, nx=3, ny=3, alternative='clustered')
```
The $X^2$ value of 22.77 is highly significant (p-value of 0.0037), leading to rejection
of CSR. If we try to use quadrats of different sizes:
```{r}
quadrat.test(redwood3, nx=4, ny=4, alternative='clustered')
quadrat.test(redwood3, nx=2, ny=2, alternative='clustered')
```
We see that the one-sided p-value for $4 \times 4$ is about 0.0002, also leading to rejection
of CSR. However the p-value for $2 \times 2$ is 0.089. It is apparent that using
different-sized quadrats may lead to different conclusions, and smaller-sized quadrats
give stronger rejection of CSR.

## Cells
We will test on the data using the 3 different-sized quadrats mentioned for the redwood
data. Here is the $3 \times 3$ quadrat counts for reference:
```{r}
quadratcount(cells, nx = 3, ny = 3)
```

```{r}
quadrat.test(cells, nx=4, ny=4, alternative='regular')
quadrat.test(cells, nx=3, ny=3, alternative='regular')
quadrat.test(cells, nx=2, ny=2, alternative='regular')
```
Since we have established that the cells data is a regular pattern, we may evaluate
the p-value as $P(\chi^2 < X^2)$ instead.

The p-values defined this way for $2 \times 2, 3 \times 3, 4 \times 4$ grids are
0.076, 0.17, 0.0004 respectively. This shows that the observed values of $X^2$ are
below expectation in all of them, and at a significance level of 0.1 we may reject
CSR except for the $3 \times 3$ grid. The failure in rejection for this grid and
the large significance level suggests that this test is weak against regular patterns.

## Beilschmiedia pendula (Lauraceae)
```{r}
quadrat.test(bei, nx=38, ny=19, alternative='clustered')
quadrat.test(bei, nx=37, ny=19, alternative='clustered')
quadrat.test(bei, nx=38, ny=18, alternative='clustered')
```
I have performed tests using $38 \times 19$, $37 \times 19$ and $38 \times 18$, 
which give expected counts of around 5. All of the p-values obtained are very small,
so there is strong evidence for rejection of CSR.

It is evident that CSR would be rejected for Beilschmiedia Pendula, using all the
methods mentioned above. Indeed, the sampling region has elevations and swamp areas,
which make the distribution of these trees an inhomogeneous process.
