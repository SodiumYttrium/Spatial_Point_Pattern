Welcome! This week I have reviewed some introductory materials to the topic of Spatial Point Patterns.
Here is a summary of them.

A spatial point pattern refers to data which is irregularly distributed over a spatial region,
such as the location of trees in an area. We denote these points as *events*. The
positions of these events are assumed to follow an underlying process, which we aim to
determine. For plant ecology, it is common to collect data by dividing the area into
a regular grid of *quadrats* and take the count of each quadrat. An alternative method is
to record the distances between a point and the neighbouring events. Both of these
methods are considered *sparse sampling methods*.

## Complete Spatial Randomness (CSR)

Complete spatial randomness (CSR), also known as the *homogeneous Poisson point process*, implies that:

(i) For a planar region $A$, with area $|A|$, the number of events is Poisson
distributed with mean $\lambda |A|$. $\lambda$, the intensity, is the mean number of events
per unit area. As the value of intensity remains constant over the whole region,
it is a homogeneous process.

(ii) Events are independent from each other and their locations are uniformly distributed
over region A.

While it may be impossible to achieve CSR in practice, tests of CSR may be helpful for
formulating ecologically interesting hypotheses of patterns and distinguishing between 'regular' and
'aggregated' data. 

## Dirichlet tessellation and Delaunay Triangulation

Dirichlet tessellation: Given $n$ distinct events in a planar region A, we assign a 'territory' for each event
so that for all points in a territory, the corresponding event is the closest event.
Events with neighbouring territories are called *continguous*.

Delaunay triangulation: Join up pairs of distinct events to form a triangularisation over the area. By
taking perpendicular bisectors of these lines we can perform the Dirichlet tessellation.

For some location-specific covariates measured at each event, such as temperature and elevation,
we can estimate the values of these covariates at other locations by considering
the vertices of the triangle that they lie in. Each vertex will contribute to the value of
the covariate proportionally to its angle.

## Monte Carlo Tests

Monte Carlo tests were introduced by Barnard (1963). They are used when the underlying distribution of random variables is unknown, to estimate the parameters based on simulations.

We can use them to test for CSR [@Besag], with the null hypothesis
stating that events are uniformly and independently distributed across region A.
One popular test statistic, proposed by Clarke and Evans (1954), is the sum of distances between each of the
n events to its nearest neighbour. We denote this as $u_1$. Relatively large values of $u_1$ may
indicate spatial regularity.

An alternative test statistic used by Bartlett (1964) was the distribution function of
distances between 2 randomly chosen points on the given square. The observed frequencies of
inter-tree distances were then compared with the expected values under CSR, using
$\chi^2$ goodness-of-fit tests. According to
Bartlett, Besag and Diggle, there was insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis
of CSR. However, there was a dependence between inter-tree measurements with a common end-point
which may invalidate the obvious conclusion.
