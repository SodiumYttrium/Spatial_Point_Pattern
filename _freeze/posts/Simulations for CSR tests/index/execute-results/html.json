The data I will be using are:\n\n- Locations of 65 Japanese black pine saplings in a square of side-length 5.7\nmetres [@Numata]\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n- Locations of 62 redwood seedlings in a square of side-length 23 metres\n[@Strauss; @MSP]\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n- Locations of 42 cell centres in a unit square [@MSP]\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n- Locations of 3604 trees of the species Beilschmiedia pendula (Lauraceae) in a 1000 by 500 metre rectangular sampling region in the tropical rainforest of Barro Colorado Island [@HF;@CHF;@Condit]\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe first 3 have been used for demonstration in Diggle's book, and my plots indeed show\nsimilar results to Diggle's.\n\n# Inter-event distances\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n## Japanese black pines\nMy replication of Diggle's plot on Japanese black pine saplings, using 99 simulations\nof CSR for the envelopes, affirms acceptance of CSR. This agrees with [@Bartlett] and\n[@Besag], who used a $\\chi^2$ test on a histogram of inter-event distances.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Redwood\n$\\hat{H}_1(t)$ is greater than $H(t)$ throughout the range, especially for very small and very\nlarge values of $H(t)$, where $\\hat{H}_1(t)$ exceeds the upper envelope. The excess\nnumber of small values of $H(t)$ may be explained by Strauss' remark that a distance of\n6 feet on the ground ($t \\approx 0.08$), was \"very roughly the range at which\na pair of seedlings could interact.\"\n\nA formal test of significance based on the measure of the discrepancy between\n$\\hat{H}_1(t)$ and $H(t)$, however, might suggest acceptance of CSR with a significance\nlevel of 0.22, according to Diggle. Indeed, $\\hat{H}_1(t)$ lies relatively close to $H(t)$\nthroughout the range. This shows that observation of the EDF plot with the simulation\nenvelopes may provide insights that formal tests of significance do not.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Cells\nAgain, a formal test of significance may suggest acceptance of CSR, with a significance\nlevel of 0.23. However with parts of the graph (especially at low values of $H(t)$)\nlying outside the simulation envelopes, it suggests otherwise. Note that for small values of $t$,\n$\\hat{H}_1(t)=0$, i.e. small inter-event distances are absent. This explains the regularity\nof the pattern. Also, for large values of $t$, $\\hat{H}_1(t)$ lies close to the upper\nenvelope. Looking at the graph depicting the data, we can observe that there are no\nevents present at the corners of the square. These empty spaces result in lack of\nlarge inter-event distances.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Beilschmiedia pendula (Lauraceae)\nClearly, with the excess of small inter-event distances and the deficit of larger\ninter-event distances, we have sufficient evidence to reject CSR. This is to be expected,\nas we see from the graph that events are clustered around certain areas, with large\nempty spaces near the middle part of the region and to the right.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](bei_H.jpg)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Nearest neighbour distance\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Japanese black pines\nThis plot suggests acceptance of CSR. According to Diggle, a formal Monte Carlo test\nbased on the squared difference between $\\hat{G}$ and $\\bar{G}$ arrives at the same\nconclusion with significance level 0.52.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Redwood\nWith a large proportion of $\\hat{G}$ lying above the upper envelope, there is strong\nevidence for rejecting CSR. This is supported by the Monte Carlo test, in which $u_1$\nis larger than all 99 simulated $u_j$.\n\nThe excess of nearest neighbour distances is typical for an aggregated pattern like\nthese redwood seedlings.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Cells\nAgain, there is strong evidence against CSR. The Monte Carlo test also gives a $u_1$\nthat is comfortably larger than all the other $u_j$. Note that there is a lack of small\nnearest neighbour distances, characteristic of regular patterns.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Beilschmiedia pendula (Lauraceae)\nSimilar to the behaviour of the redwood saplings, there is a large proportion of\n$\\hat{G}$ above the upper envelope, so we may reject CSR.\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](bei_G.jpg)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Point to nearest event distances\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Japanese black pines\nThis plot is obtained using a regular grid of 256 ($16 \\times 16$) points over the window. We see\nthat $\\hat{F}$ lies close to $F$ throughout the range and between the envelopes.\nJust like our previous analysis of this data, we accept CSR.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Redwood\nAgain, we obtain the plot using the regular pattern of 256 points. Clearly $\\hat{F}$\nlies below the lower envelope for most of the range, suggesting rejection of CSR. This\nis a typical behaviour of aggregated pattern.\n\nPerforming a Monte Carlo test based on the squared differences between $\\hat{F}$\nand $\\bar{F}$ gives the same conclusion, with $u_1$ larger than all 99 simulated $u_j$.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Cells\nThis time we use a regular grid of 196 ($14 \\times 14$) points. With a large proportion of\nthe graph of $\\hat{F}$ lying above the upper envelope, CSR is rejected. The Monte\nCarlo test agrees with this at the significant level of 0.02, according to Diggle.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Beilschmiedia pendula (Lauraceae)\nThe regular grid I used is of 7200 ($120 \\times 60$) points. Again, similar to\nthe redwood saplings, $\\hat{F}$ lies below the lower envelope for the most part.\nThis suggests that CSR may be rejected, and this is an aggregated pattern.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](bei_F.jpg)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Quadrat counts\n\n## Japanese black pines\nFor the data set of Japanese black pine saplings, we may use a $3 \\times 3$ grid to\nensure that the expected frequencies are at least 5.
