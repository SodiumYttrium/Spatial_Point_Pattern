To do this, the built-in\nfunction `ppm` from `spatstat` would be helpful. Then the estimated pair correlation function (PCF) from the actual\ndata will be plotted with the upper and lower envelopes of 99 simulations based on the\nfitted model for comparison. The PCF is associated with the rate of change of the K-function:\n$$\n\\rho(r) = \\frac{K'(r)}{2\\pi r}\n$$\nAnd it should equal to 1 if the process is stationary ($K(r)=\\pi r^2$). Using the PCF\nover the K-function could remove the effect of cumulation in the K-function, allowing\nfor clearer observation of the behaviour.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='index_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-1_f18565fe5302ec106960ca6087239c35'}\n\n:::\n\n\n# Acalypha diversifolia\n\n::: {.cell hash='index_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-2_1c37504742fda73c579a2eee572ce3ab'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Cecropia insignis\n\n::: {.cell hash='index_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-3_00f86fec94f25560a2f531907cd38e5a'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Cupania seemannii\n\n::: {.cell hash='index_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-4_c20e3cb2c3eabcc8375d35e9016e22e8'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nIn all of the cases, the PCF of the data lies above the simulation envelopes for small\ndistances, then drops below the envelopes for large distances. These suggest small distance\naggregation. Since there are less pairs of events with larger inter-event distances,\nthe variance for the K-function at these distances is large.\n\nIt is apparent that the inhomogeneous Poisson process model is not a good fit for\nthe data, and we would have to explore other models in order to better estimate\nthe spread of these tree species at this location.",
