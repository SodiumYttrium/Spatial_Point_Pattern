If the process is stationary, \\(\\lambda_2(x, y) \\equiv \\lambda_2(x-y)\\). If the process is additionally isotropic, i.e. all process properties are invariant under rotation, we can reduce \\(\\lambda_2(x-y)\\) to \\(\\lambda_2(t)\\), with \\(t=\\|x-y\\|\\).\nThe pair correlation function is defined as \\(\\rho(t)=\\lambda_2(t)/\\lambda^2\\). For intensity-reweighted (second-order) stationary processes, \\[\n\\frac{\\lambda_2(x,y)}{\\lambda(x)\\lambda(y)} = \\rho(t)\n\\] only depends on \\(t=\\|x-y\\|\\).\n\n\nThe K function\nThe K function also characterises second-order properties of a stationary, isotropic process. It is defined as the following: \\[\nK(t) = \\frac{E[N_0(t)]}{\\lambda}\n\\] where \\(N_0(t)\\) is the number of other events taking place within distance \\(t\\) of an arbitrary event. In order to link \\(K(t)\\) and \\(\\lambda_2(t)\\), we will assume that multiple events cannot occur at the same point. \\(E[N(dx)] \\sim P\\{N(dx) = N(dy)=1\\}\\), due to ratio of both quantities tending to 1 as \\(|dx| \\rightarrow 0\\). Under these conditions, \\(E[N_0(t)]\\) can be computed by integrating the conditional intensity over the disc centering at the origin and radius \\(t\\): \\[\n\\begin{align}\n  \\lambda K(t) &= \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^t \\lambda_c(x|o)xdxd\\theta \\\\\n  &= \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda} \\int_0^t \\lambda_2(x)xdx\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nRather than taking the exact locations of each event, sometimes we prefer to take counts in quadrats. The quadrat count distribution, \\[\np_n(A) = P\\{N(A)=n\\}\n\\] provides a summary description of the process. Since \\(A\\) is arbitrary, we can summarise the distribution by the first few moments and express them as functions of \\(A\\). In particular, \\(E[N(A)]=\\int_A \\lambda(x)dx\\) reduces to \\(\\lambda |A|\\) for a stationary process.\nBy orderliness, \\[\n\\begin{align}\nE[N(A)^2] &= E[\\{\\int_ANdx\\}]^2 \\\\\n&= E[\\int_ANdx + \\int_A \\int_A NdxNdy] \\\\\n&= \\lambda|A| + \\int_A \\int_A\\lambda_2(x-y)dxdy\n\\end{align}\n\\] And we have: \\[\nVar\\{N(A)\\} = \\int_A \\int_A \\lambda_2(x-y)dxdy + \\lambda|A|(1-\\lambda|A|)\n\\] # Multivariate processes As defined before, \\(N_j(A)\\) is the number of type \\(j\\) events in the planar region \\(A\\). If we assume stationarity, isotropy and orderliness, the first order intensities are constants: \\[\n\\lambda_j = E[N_j(A)]/|A|\n\\] The second order intensities are: \\[\n\\lambda_{ij}(t) = \\lim_{|dx| \\rightarrow 0\\\\ |dy| \\rightarrow 0}\n\\{\\frac{E[N_i(dx)N_j(dy)]}{|dx||dy|}\\}\n\\] And the K-function would be defined as follows: \\[\nK_{ij}(t) = \\frac{E[N_{0ij}(t)]}{\\lambda_j}\n\\] Note that \\(\\lambda_{ij}(t) = \\lambda_{ji}(t)\\) and \\(K_{ij}(t) = K_{ji}(t)\\).\n\n\nIndependence and random labelling\nWe might be interested in testing whether 2 different types of events have spatial association in a bivariate process. 2 of the possible hypotheses we could consider are:\n\nIndependence - the 2 types of events are generated by 2 independent univariate processes\nRandom labelling - the 2 types of events can be obtained by labelling the events from a univariate process with independent Bernoulli trials.\n\nFor 2 independent processes of 2 event types, \\(K_{12}(t)=\\pi t^2\\). This follows from the fact that the expected number of type 2 events in a disc of radius \\(t\\) centred around an arbitrary type 1 event, \\(E[N_{012}(t)]=\\lambda_2 \\pi t^2\\).\nAs for any randomly labelled process, \\(K_{11}(t)=K_{22}(t)=K_{12}(t)=K(t)\\), the K-function for the unlabelled univariate process.\nIndependence and random labelling are equivalent if and only if both types of events are Poisson processes."

    "text": "Welcome! This week I have reviewed some introductory materials to the topic of Spatial Point Patterns. Here is a summary of them.\nA spatial point pattern refers to data which is irregularly distributed over a spatial region, such as the location of trees in an area. We denote these points as events. The positions of these events are assumed to follow an underlying process, which we aim to determine. For plant ecology, it is common to collect data by dividing the area into a regular grid of quadrats and take the count of each quadrat. An alternative method is to record the distances between a point and the neighbouring events. Both of these methods are considered sparse sampling methods."

They are used when the underlying distribution of random variables is unknown, to estimate the parameters based on simulations.\nWe can use them to test for CSR (Besag and Diggle 1977), with the null hypothesis stating that events are uniformly and independently distributed across region A. One popular test statistic, proposed by Clarke and Evans (1954), is the sum of distances between each of the n events to its nearest neighbour. We denote this as \\(u_1\\). Relatively large values of \\(u_1\\) may indicate spatial regularity.\nAn alternative test statistic used by Bartlett (1964) was the distribution function of distances between 2 randomly chosen points on the given square. The observed frequencies of inter-tree distances were then compared with the expected values under CSR, using \\(\\chi^2\\) goodness-of-fit tests. According to Bartlett, Besag and Diggle, there was insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis of CSR. However, there was a dependence between inter-tree measurements with a common end-point which may invalidate the obvious conclusion."

This is due to the ratio of \\(E[N_0(t)]\\) and \\(\\lambda\\) being unchanged.\nAn obvious estimator for \\(\\lambda\\) is \\(\\hat{\\lambda} = n/|A|\\), the number of observed events divided by the area. As for \\(E[N_0(t)]\\), the expected number of further events within distance \\(t\\) of an arbitrary event, we can use the following estimator: \\[\n\\tilde{E}(t) = \\frac{1}{n} \\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j \\ne i} I(r_{ij} \\leq t)\n\\] where \\(I\\) is the indicator function and \\(r_{ij} = ||x_i - x_j||\\).
