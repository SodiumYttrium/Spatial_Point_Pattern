I am Natalie Young, an undergraduate Mathematics student at Imperial College London.
I will be updating this blog weekly to record my research on spatial point process and its
applications in Ecology, guided by Statistical Analysis of Spatial and Spatio-temporal Point Patterns
by P. J. Diggle. [@DiggleBook]

Point process models are a stochastic model to describe
the locations of localised events in space, time or both. In particular, we will
apply it to the distribution of different tree species over a 50ha tropical rainforest site on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. [@bciweb; @Condit; @bci]The ecological data for this site is publicly available, courtesy of the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute.
